    "In this project I tackled Sudoku problem. The method I'm using can solve any valid sudoku. There are two distinct agents that solve any given sudoku: a purely **logical agent** and a **tree search (or backtracking)** agent. The solver first tries to exhaust the feasible candidate list of any unsolved cell by applying predefined logical solution techniques. If it cannot find any valid logic after sweeping through the sudoku, it then solves the rest of the puzzle using backtracking. Any **easy** sudoku will be solved purely logically."

    "**Solving Sudoku using Tree Search (aka Backtracking, aka Brute Force)**: This method is a recursive depth-first tree search algorithm for a sudoku solution. The code generates valid candidates for each cell. Then  it picks a candidate as a solution for one cell. Given this solution, it picks a candidate for the next cell, and checks if the sudoku is valid. The same logic applies to the next cells. If the candidate it picked doesn't result in a valid solution, then it picks the next candidate for the cell. If all the candidates for a cell are exhausted, and the sudoku is still invalid, it backtracks and picks another candidate for the previous cell. It will backtrack as much as needed until a valid combination of candidates are picked.\n",

    "**Pointing Pairs**: if a candidate is present in only two Cells of a box, then it must be the solution for one of these two cells. If these two cells belong to the same Row or Column, then this candidate can not be the solution in any other cell of the same Row or Column, respectively. [4]\n"

    "As we can see above, for the first three puzzles (\"Easy\" as defined in the intro), the solver could fully solve them logically. And it took a fraction of a second to solve each of these. For the last two puzzles, the logical solver gave up after exhausting the options after trying the taught techniques. Then it had to apply the brute force method. The Medium1 puzzle took cost the solver 29s, but the Medium2 (which should be labelled as hard) took the solver 162s! In the first case, the solver was able to apply some logic and eliminate some of the possible candidates. The second solver, however, was only able to find one valid logic, and the rest of the cells it had to solve using backtracking"
